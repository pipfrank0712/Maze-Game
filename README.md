# Maze-Game
Following Youtuber Christian Thompson coding Maze Game. This is a very helpful project. The key gists I learned: 
1. using class. With class I gathered all the properties and functions all in one place. Later, by creating a instance from such class, it will inherit all the properties and functions. It make the code very clean and very helpful when I have multiple instances which share lots of same features. Some practice on class still required. But it seems to me a very powerful tool. 
2. Enemies with random movement and little AI by tracking the player within certain distance are very interesting. More important, they can be realized with very simple code. This is the thing I like coding and CT's tutorials: simplifying things seems complex. 
3. The idea of generating map system, locating player, enemies, items is cool. 
4. using timers seems to be extremely helpful. I still need to practice on it. 
5. With the knowledge i learned in this tutorial, I added a function that the player can shoot and kill enemies to earn gold.
